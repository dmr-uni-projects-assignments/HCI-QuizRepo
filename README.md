## Original Page
The original page is a customer support chatbox.

## Modified page
To add to the design patterns:
- Navigation: Already good with header
- Input and forms: A keybind for an enter button was added. This lets people chat more easily
- Feedback & status: A warning was added to ensure that the user creates and selects a ticket first. Furthermore, responses are delayed to feel more real.
- Layout & structure: Mobile responsive design was added.
- Data presentation: The chats were separated between messages and responses so the user can differentiate which is which.
